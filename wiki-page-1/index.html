       <b>Crown Shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement, canopy shyness, or inter-crown spacing)
       is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees 
       do not touch each other, instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. 
       This is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of 
       different species.

        Possible physiological explanations
       <hr>
        <p>
            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain It has been discussed in scientific literature 
            since the 1920s.The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species.

        <p>
            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas 
            suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds. The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies 
            suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion
